How to use sound in Vanilla JS

the [new¹ Audio()] constructor allows you to create a new HTMLAudioElement¹⁰. Pass in the url of the audio file like so:

let beat = new Audio('/path/to/my/beat.mp3');

After it is created, you can use the same methods avalible on an HTML <audio> element.

// To play the beat
beat.play();

// To pause the beat
beat.pause();


If there ever are errors where it doesnt play, asking chatGPT helped me, it suggested adding a line like so

// Preload the audio file
beat.load();

If a preload doesnt work you can try to "rewind" the audio by setting the current time of the audio to 0 right before you play it again like so.

// Rewind audio
beat.currentTime = 0;

If this still doesnt work you can try an audio pool, where you create and array of different audio elements to allow them to be used at different times like so

// Initialize a size
POO_SIZE = 5;
audioPool = [];
currentIndex = 0;

// fill the pool
for ( let i = 0 ; i < POOL_SIZE ; i++ ) {
  let audio = new Audio("path/to/src.mp3");
  //audioPool[i] = audio CAN ALSO DO
  audioPool.push(audio);
}

Then you call the pool like so

// make the sound you play
let sound = audioPool[currentIndex];

// rewind and play
sound.currentTime = 0;
sound.play();

// increment 
currentIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % POOL_SIZE;
