the [new¹ Audio()] constructor allows you to create a new HTMLAudioElement¹⁰. Pass in the url of the audio file like so:

let beat = new Audio('/path/to/my/beat.mp3');

After it is created, you can use the same methods avalible on an HTML <audio> element.

// To play the beat
beat.play

// To pause the beat
beat.pause();

beat.load();
